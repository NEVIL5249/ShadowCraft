## Overview

ShadowCraft is a Tailwind CSS plugin that introduces a structured, multi-layered shadow architecture designed to replicate realistic depth and spatial hierarchy in modern UI systems.

Unlike traditional shadows, ShadowCraft applies volumetric layering principles to achieve precise, high-fidelity visual depth.

It is built for developers and designers focused on professional interface quality.

    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@nevil5249/shadowcraft')
  ],
}
```
